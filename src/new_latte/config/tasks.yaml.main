analyze_and_generate_files:
  description: >
    ACTUALLY analyze the Python repository: {github_repo_url} repository ONLY to detect:
    1. Python version (from requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, or runtime.txt)
    2. Python dependencies (requirements.txt, setup.py, pyproject.toml)
    3. Python test framework (pytest, unittest, nose)
    4. Python deployment (Flask, Django, FastAPI, or simple Python app)

    IMPORTANT:
      - This is a PYTHON project. Do NOT mention npm, node, java, or other languages.
      - Default to Python 3.9 if no version is specified in the repository.

    Only use Python tools: pip, pytest, python, pylint, etc.

  expected_output: >
    Python-specific analysis (100 words max):
    - Python Version: [detected version]
    - Dependencies: [pip install from requirements.txt/setup.py]
    - Tests: [pytest/unittest command]
    - App Type: [Flask/Django/FastAPI/CLI app]

    Create 3 optimized GitHub Actions workflows for PYTHON projects ONLY:
    1. test.yml - Set up Python, install dependencies including pytest, run tests
    2. build.yml - Install Python dependencies, archive .py or source files, and upload artifacts
    3. deploy.yml - Deploy Python app (Flask/Django/FastAPI)

    Required conventions:
    - Always use actions/checkout@v4
    - Always use actions/setup-python@v4
    - Always use actions/upload-artifact@v4 (✅ latest version)
    - Install Python dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (check existence)
    - Always install pytest manually: `pip install pytest`
    - Use `python -m pytest` to run tests
    - For build:
        - If `pyproject.toml` exists: use `pip install build && python -m build`
        - If only `setup.py` exists: use `pip install wheel && python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
        - Always upload the `dist/` directory using actions/upload-artifact@v4



    ❌ DO NOT:
    - Use actions/upload-artifact@v3 (deprecated)
    - Use archive-workflow-job (non-existent)
    - Include placeholder files like `yourapplication.py`

  expected_output: >
    3 Python GitHub Actions workflows:
    1. test.yml (20-30 lines): Validates dependencies, installs pytest, runs tests
    2. build.yml (20-30 lines): Archives code using zip and uploads via upload-artifact@v4
    3. deploy.yml (20-30 lines): Deploys Python app using detected framework (Flask, Django, etc.)

    All workflows must:
    - Be 100% Python specific
    - Be valid for GitHub Actions
    - Avoid deprecated actions or broken versions
    - Include practical and reusable steps

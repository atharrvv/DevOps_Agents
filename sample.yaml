- Identifying database connections, external service dependencies, and infrastructure needs

### Key Responsibilities
1. **Project Structure Analysis**
   - Map out the complete directory structure
   - Identify main application entry points
   - Locate configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.py, requirements.txt, Pipfile, etc.)
   - Find environment files (.env examples, config templates)

2. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Extract all Python dependencies with version constraints
   - Identify system-level dependencies (apt packages, brew formulas)
   - Detect database requirements (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, etc.)
   - Find external service integrations (AWS services, APIs, etc.)

3. **Testing Framework Detection**
   - Identify testing framework (pytest, unittest, nose2, etc.)
   - Locate test directories and test file patterns
   - Find test configuration files (pytest.ini, tox.ini, etc.)
   - Determine test execution commands and parameters
   - Identify code coverage tools and requirements

4. **Build and Packaging Analysis**
   - Detect build tools (setuptools, poetry, flit, etc.)
